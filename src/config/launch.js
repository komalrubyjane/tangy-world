// TEMPORARY PUBLIC LAUNCH MODE — one switch for the controlled launch.
// See docs/LAUNCH.md for what it changes and how to turn it off.
//
// While on, the public site keeps its content (story, archive, gallery, TV,
// artists, team) but:
//   - no session from the events table is listed or bookable publicly
//     (useEvents returns nothing; /sessions/:id shows "Coming soon");
//   - /sessions ("Book Now") shows the one TEMPORARY_SESSION below, whose
//     button opens the team's Google Form — never checkout or Razorpay;
//   - public sign-in/sign-up, the Passport, partner dashboards and the artist
//     portal show "Coming soon", and forms that need sign-in say so;
//   - placeholder forms that save nothing (Inner Circle, postcard) are replaced
//     by a "Coming soon" note.
// The admin console (/admin-portal), its own sign-in, staff check-in and staff
// invitations are not affected, and no database data is touched.
//
// It is ON unless the build sets VITE_TEMPORARY_LAUNCH=false, so a deploy
// can't fall back to the full site by accident. `import.meta.env` is absent
// when Node imports this file (e2e/navigation.mjs via siteNav.js).
const env = import.meta.env || {};

// The one session shown on /sessions during the launch. Fill in ONLY what the
// team has confirmed; every field left null is simply not shown (the card
// never guesses a date, venue, price or line-up). Do not copy an old session's
// details here. `image` is a path under public/ (e.g. '/media/opt/...webp').
