#   1. checks the package: 0004 absent, unchanged copies byte-identical to
#      supabase/migrations/, the two .production.sql files differ from their
#      originals by deletions only
#   2. applies every package file in order, each as its own transaction
#   3. runs the read-only production inventory and the empty-database checks
#   4. runs every supabase/tests/*.test.sql suite on the same database — no
#      seed or mock content is ever inserted; suites create their own test
#      rows inside their own transaction and roll them back
